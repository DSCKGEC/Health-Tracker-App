If your liver is damaged bilirubin can leak out of your liver and into your blood. When too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream it can cause jaundice a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow. Signs of jaundice along with a bilirubin blood test can help your health care provider find out if you have liver disease.,A bilirubin blood test is used to check the health of your liver. The test is also commonly used to help diagnose newborn jaundice. Many healthy babies get jaundice because their livers aren't developed enough to get rid of enough bilirubin. Newborn jaundice is usually not harmful and clears up within a few weeks. But in some cases high bilirubin levels can lead to brain damage so infants are often tested as a precaution.,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

Bone marrow makes different types of blood cells including:,Bone marrow tests are used to:,Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy procedures are usually done at the same time. A health care provider will collect the marrow samples for testing. Usually the samples can be collected in about ten minutes.
BRAF Genetic Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/braf-genetic-test/,A BRAF genetic test looks for a change known as a mutation in a gene called BRAF. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father.The BRAF gene makes a protein that helps control cell growth. It's known as an oncogene. An oncogene works like a gas pedal on a car. Normally an oncogene turns on cell growth as needed. But if you have a BRAF mutation it's like the gas pedal is stuck down and the gene can't stop cells from growing. Uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer.,The test is most often used to look for a BRAF mutation in patients with melanoma or other BRAF-related cancers. Certain cancer medicines are especially effective in people who have a BRAF mutation. The same medicines are not as effective and sometimes dangerous to people who don't have the mutation.,Most BRAF tests are done in a procedure called a tumor biopsy. During a biopsy a health care provider will take out a small piece of tissue by cutting or scraping the surface of a tumor. If your provider needs to test tumor tissue from inside your body he or she may use a special needle to withdraw the sample.

This virus causes chickenpox and shingles. When you are first infected with VZV you get chickenpox. Once you get chickenpox you can't get it again. The virus remains in your nervous system but is dormant (inactive). Later in life VZV can become active and can cause shingles. Unlike chicken pox you can get shingles more than once but it is rare.Both chickenpox and shingles cause blistering skin rashes. Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease that causes red itchy sores (pox) all over the body. It used to be a very common childhood disease infecting nearly all children in the United States. But since a chickenpox vaccine was introduced in 1995 there have been far fewer cases. Chickenpox may be uncomfortable but it's usually a mild illness in healthy children. But it can be serious for adults pregnant women newborns and people with weakened immune systems.,Health care providers can usually diagnose chickenpox or shingles with a visual examination. Tests are sometimes ordered to check for immunity to the varicella zoster virus (VZV). You have immunity if you've had chickenpox before or have had the chickenpox vaccine. If you have immunity it means you can't get chickenpox but you can still get shingles later in life.,You will need to provide a sample of blood from your vein or from the fluid in one of your blisters. Blood tests check for antibodies to the VZV. Blister tests check for the virus itself.

The purpose of a drug test is to look for drug use and misuse which includes:,Drug testing is used to find out whether you have been using or misusing one or more drugs. But it can't diagnose a drug use disorder (addiction).,Drug testing may be done in a variety of locations including labs hospitals drug treatment centers and workplaces. The most commonly used drug tests require that you give a urine sample. You will be given instructions for how to collect your sample.
Drug Use Screening Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/drug-use-screening-tests/,Drug use screening tests are questionnaires designed to find out if you are abusing drugs. Drug abuse is a pattern of using drugs that can cause serious problems in your work relationships and health. Drug abuse can include taking illegal drugs or misusing legal drugs. Misuse means using the drugs for a nonmedical reason such as getting high or taking more than the prescribed dose. It can also mean taking someone else's medicine or taking medicine in a different way than you are supposed to such as crushing and snorting tablets.Drug abuse is a disease that can make you physically and mentally dependent on drugs. A drug use screening test can help your provider make an effective treatment plan for you.,Drug use screening tests are used to diagnose drug abuse. Some tests can also show if you are at low moderate or high risk for complications from drug abuse.,Drug use screening may be done by your primary care provider or a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health. SBIRT is targeted to developing short-term counseling and educational strategies to change unhealthy drug use. If your test shows you have or are at risk for a serious drug problem a long-term treatment plan may be recommended.
Dysphagia Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/dysphagia-tests/,Dysphagia is a term that means difficulty swallowing. Normally when you swallow food moves easily from your mouth down your throat and into your stomach. The food travels through a long tube called the esophagus. If you have dysphagia it can take more time and effort to move food from your mouth to your stomach. It can be painful and may even prevent you from swallowing at all. Dysphagia can happen at any age but is more common in older adults and people who have certain neurologic diseases. There are many conditions that can cause dysphagia. Some are very serious. Dysphagia tests can help screen for or diagnose these conditions. Other names: bedside swallow clinical swallow dysphagia screening tool fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallow (FEES) barium swallow esophagram videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) upper endoscopy,Dysphagia tests are used to find out why you have trouble swallowing.,There are several different types of dysphagia tests. Depending on your symptoms you may have one or more of the following tests:EndoscopyA bedside swallow test is a common type of dysphagia screening tool. Other tools include a questionnaire and a water swallow test.Barium Swallow
Elastography,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/elastography/,An elastography also known as liver elastography is a type of imaging test that checks the liver for fibrosis. Fibrosis is a condition that reduces blood flow to and inside the liver. This causes the buildup of scar tissue. Left untreated fibrosis can lead to serious problems in the liver. These include cirrhosis liver cancer and liver failure. But early diagnosis and treatment can reduce or even reverse the effects of fibrosis.There are two types of liver elastography tests:,An elastography is used to diagnose fatty liver disease (FLD) and fibrosis. FLD is a condition in which fat builds up in the liver. This fat can lead to cell death and fibrosis.,During an ultrasound (Fibroscan) elastography:
Electrocardiogram,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/electrocardiogram/,An electrocardiogram (EKG) test is a simple painless procedure that measures electrical signals in your heart. Each time your heart beats an electrical signal travels through the heart. An EKG can show if your heart is beating at a normal rate and strength. It also helps show the size and position of your heart's chambers. An abnormal EKG can be a sign of heart disease or damage.Other names: ECG test,An EKG test is used to find and/or monitor various heart disorders. These include:,An EKG test may be done in a provider's office outpatient clinic or a hospital. During the procedure:
Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/electromyography-emg-and-nerve-conduction-studies/,Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies are tests that measure the electrical activity of muscles and nerves. Nerves send out electrical signals to make your muscles react in certain ways. As your muscles react they give off these signals which can then be measured.,EMG and nerve conduction studies are used to help diagnose a variety of muscle and nerve disorders. An EMG test helps find out if muscles are responding the right way to nerve signals. Nerve conduction studies help diagnose nerve damage or disease. When EMG tests and nerve conduction studies are done together it helps providers tell if your symptoms are caused by a muscle disorder or a nerve problem.,If you are having both tests the nerve conduction study will be done first.
Epithelial Cells in Urine,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/epithelial-cells-in-urine/,Epithelial cells are a type of cell that covers the inside and outside of the surfaces of your body. They are found on your skin blood vessels and organs including your urinary tract.An epithelial cells in urine test looks at a sample of your urine (pee) under a microscope to count the number of epithelial cells in your urine. It's normal to have a small number of certain types of epithelial cells in urine. A large number may indicate a urinary tract infection kidney disease or other serious medical condition.,An epithelial cells in urine test is a part of a urinalysisA urinalysis may include a visual check of your urine sample tests for certain chemicals and examination under a microscope to look for certain types of cells. An epithelial cells in urine test is part of a microscopic exam of urine.,"You will need to give a urine sample of your urine for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe a small container and instructions for how to use the ""clean catch"" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample:"
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR),https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate-esr/,An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that that can show if you have inflammation in your body. Inflammation is your immune system's response to injury infection and many types of conditions including immune system disorders certain cancers and blood disorders.Erythrocytes are red blood cells. To do an ESR test a sample of your blood is sent to a lab. A health care professional places the sample in a tall thin test tube and measures how quickly the red blood cells settle or sink to the bottom of the tube. Normally red blood cells sink slowly. But inflammation makes red blood cells stick together in clumps. These clumps of cells are heavier than single cells so they sink faster.,An ESR test can be used with other tests to help diagnose conditions that cause inflammation. It can also be used to help monitor these conditions. Many types of conditions cause inflammation including arthritis vasculitis infection and inflammatory bowel disease. An ESR may also be used to monitor an existing condition.,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Esophageal pH Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/esophageal-ph-test/,An esophageal pH test measures how often stomach acid enters the esophagus the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. It also measures how long the acid stays there. The test involves placing a catheter (a thin tube) or a special device called a pH probe into your esophagus. The catheter or device will measure your acid level (known as pH level) for 24 to 96 hours.The test can show if you have acid reflux or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Acid reflux is a disorder that happens when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. When the acid touches the esophagus it can cause a burning feeling in your chest or neck. This is known as heartburn.,An esophageal pH test is most often used to diagnose acid reflux or GERD. It may also be used to see if treatment for GERD is effective.,An esophageal pH test may be done using a thin tube called a catheter or with a wireless pH probe (a small capsule-like device).
Estrogen Levels Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/estrogen-levels-test/,An estrogen test measures the level of estrogens usually in a sample of your blood but sometimes in urine (pee).Estrogens are a group of hormones that play a key role in female reproductive health including puberty menstruation pregnancy and menopause. Estrogens are also important for heart bone and brain health in males and females. But males need estrogen in much smaller amounts.,estradiol and/or estrone testing may be used:,If you are tested at your provider's office or a lab you will provide a blood or urine sample. If you use an at-home test You'll collect a sample of saliva and send it to a lab for testing. Ask your provider which test is best to use. Be sure to follow all the instructions that come with your kit and discuss your results with your provider.
Estrogen Receptor Progesterone Receptor Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/estrogen-receptor-progesterone-receptor-tests/,Estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests are used to help guide breast cancer treatment. Receptors are proteins that attach to certain substances. ER/PR tests look for receptors that attach to the hormones estrogen and progesterone in a sample of breast cancer tissue. Estrogen and progesterone play key roles in a woman's sexual development and reproductive functions. Men also have these hormones but in much smaller amounts.About 70 percent of all breast cancers in women have receptors that attach to estrogen and/or progesterone. About 80 percent to 90 percent of breast cancers in men have these receptors. Breast cancers with estrogen and/or progesterone receptors include the following types:,ER/PR tests are used to guide treatment for breast cancer patients.,Your provider will need to take a sample of breast tissue in a procedure called a breast biopsy a surgeon will make a small cut in your skin to remove all or part of a breast lump. A surgical biopsy is sometimes done if the lump can't be reached with a needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include the following steps.

In the United States about a third of older adults who live at home and about half of people living in nursing homes fall at least once a year. There are many factors that increase the risk of falling in older adults. These include mobility problems balance disorders chronic illnesses and impaired vision. Many falls cause at least some injury. These range from mild bruising to broken bones head injuries and even death. In fact falls are a leading cause of death in older adults. A fall risk assessment checks to see how likely it is that you will fall. It is mostly done for older adults. The assessment usually includes: An initial screening. This includes a series of questions about your overall health and if you've had previous falls or problems with balance standing and/or walking. A set of tasks known as fall assessment tools. These tools test your strength balance and gait (the way you walk). Other names: fall risk evaluation fall risk screening assessment and intervention,A fall risk assessment is used to find out if you have a low moderate or high risk of falling. If the assessment shows you are at an increased risk your health care provider and/or caregiver may recommend strategies to prevent falls and reduce the chance of injury.,Many providers use an approach developed by the CDC called STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injuries). STEADI includes screening assessing and intervention. Interventions are recommendations that may reduce your risk of falling.
Fasting for a Blood Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/fasting-for-a-blood-test/,If your health care provider has told you to fast before a blood test it means you should not eat or drink anything except water for several hours before your test. When you eat and drink normally those foods and beverages are absorbed into your bloodstream. That could affect the results of certain types of blood tests.,The most common types of tests that require fasting include:diabetes.,No. Juice coffee soda and other beverages can get in your bloodstream and affect your results. In addition you
Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT),https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/fecal-occult-blood-test-fobt/,A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) looks at a sample of your stool (poop) to check for blood. Occult blood means that you can't see it with the naked eye. And fecal means that it is in your stool.Blood in your stool means there is bleeding in the digestive tract. The bleeding may be caused by a variety of conditions including:,A fecal occult blood test is commonly used as a screening test to help find colorectal cancer before you have symptoms. The test also has other uses. It may be done when there is concern about bleeding in the digestive tract from other conditions.anemiaIn certain cases the test is used to help find the cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)But a fecal occult blood test alone cannot diagnose any condition. If your test results show blood in your stool you will likely need other tests to diagnose the exact cause.,Usually your provider will give you a kit to collect samples of your stool (poop) at home. The kit will include instructions on how to do the test.
Ferritin Blood Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ferritin-blood-test/,A ferritin blood test measures the level of ferritin in your blood. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron inside your cells. You need iron to make healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles bone marrow and organs including brain development in children.Too little or too much iron in your body can cause serious health problems if not treated. A ferritin blood test can show how much iron you have stored in your body.,A ferritin blood test is used to help check your iron levels.

But your provider may:
Flu (Influenza) Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/flu-influenza-test/,Flu is short for influenza a respiratory infection caused by a virus. A flu test helps your health care provider find out if you have the flu. If do you have the flu your provider may prescribe medicine to help fight the virus if needed. The medicine is called antiviral medicine. It works best when started within two days after you first feel sick. Antiviral medicine may help lessen flu symptoms and shorten the time you're sick by about one day. The flu is most common during certain times of the year known as flu season. In the United States flu season can begin as early as October and end as late as May. The virus usually spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing. You can also get the flu by touching a surface that has the flu virus on it and then touching your nose eyes or mouth. Most people who get the flu will feel sick with muscle aches fever and other uncomfortable symptoms. They usually recover in a week or two. For certain people such as children under age 5 adults age 65 and over and people with long-lasting health conditions the flu can cause very serious illness and even death.,Flu tests are used to help you find out whether you have the flu. Flu tests are also used to watch for flu outbreaks in the community and for identifying the type of flu virus that is causing the infection.,A flu test requires a sample of fluid from your nose or throat. There are two ways to collect a sample for testing:At-home tests are also available for flu testing. It's very important to follow all the instructions that come with your test kit.

After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Food Allergy Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/food-allergy-testing/,A food allergy is a condition that causes your immune system to treat a normally harmless type of food as if was a dangerous virus bacteria or other infectious agent. The immune system response to a food allergy ranges from mild rashes to abdominal pain to a life-threatening complication called anaphylactic shock.Food allergies are more common in children than adults affecting about 5 percent of children in the United States. Many children outgrow their allergies as they get older. Almost 90 percent of all food allergies are caused by the following foods:,Food allergy testing is used to find out if you or your child has an allergy to a specific food. It may also be used to find out whether you have a true allergy or instead a sensitivity to a food.nauseaFood sensitivity also called food intolerance is often confused with a food allergy. The two conditions can have similar symptoms but complications can be very different.gasA food allergy is an immune system reaction that can affect organs throughout the body. It can cause dangerous health conditions. Food sensitivity is usually much less serious. If you have a food sensitivity your body can't properly digest a certain food or a food bothers your digestive system. Symptoms of food sensitivity are mostly limited to digestive problems such as abdominal pain diarrheaCommon food sensitivities include:,The testing may begin with your allergist performing a physical exam and asking about your symptoms. After that he or she will perform one or more of the following tests:
Free Light Chains,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/free-light-chains/,Light chains are proteins made by plasma cells a type of white blood cell. Plasma cells also make immunoglobulins (antibodies). Immunoglobulins help protect the body against illness and infections. Immunoglobulins are formed when light chains link up with heavy chains another type of protein. When light chains link up with heavy chains they are known as Normally plasma cells make a small amount of extra light chains that don't bind with heavy chains. They are instead released into the bloodstream. These unlinked chains are known as,A free light chains test is used to help diagnose or monitor plasma cell disorders.,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Fungal Culture Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/fungal-culture-test/,A fungal culture test helps diagnose fungal infections. Fungal infections may happen if you are exposed to fungi (more than one fungus). Fungi are plant-like life forms such as yeasts and molds. Fungi live everywhere:,A fungal culture test is used to find out whether you have a fungal infection. The test may help identify the type of fungus that you have. The test is also used to help guide treatment and to see if treatment is working.,Fungi can infect different parts of the body. To do a fungal culture test you will need to provide a sample of cells or fluid from the part of your body where the fungi may be growing. The most common types of fungal tests are:Sputum CultureAfter your sample is collected it will be sent to a lab for analysis. You may not get your results right away. That's because the sample usually needs time to grow so that there's enough to test. Many types of fungi grow within a day or two and other types can take a few weeks.
G6PD Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/g6pd-test/,This test measures the amount of G6PD in the blood. G6PD stands for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase an enzyme that helps red blood cells work properly. Red blood cells move oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow reproduce and stay healthy.If you don't have enough G6PD it's known as G6PD deficiency. This is a genetic disorder that mostly affects males. G6PD deficiency can cause the destruction of red blood cells. When red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them it's called hemolytic anemia. If you have hemolytic anemia your cells don't get all the oxygen they need.,A G6PD test is used to check for a G6PD deficiency (not enough G6PD).,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Galactosemia Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/galactosemia-tests/,A galactosemia test is a blood test given to newborns to check for a rare genetic disorder called galactosemia. This disorder prevents the body from breaking down a simple sugar called galactose. Galactose is found in many foods and all dairy products. This includes breast milk and milk-based baby formulas.Normally certain enzymes break down galactose. Galactosemia happens when a genetic change affects the function of these enzymes. There are three types of galactosemia. The type depends on which enzyme is affected:,A galactosemia test is used to help diagnose galactosemia in a baby. It may also help identify whether it is a GALT GALK or GALE deficiency.,A health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle.

Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/gamma-glutamyl-transferase-ggt-test/,A gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test measures the amount of GGT in the blood. GGT is an enzyme found throughout the body but it is mostly found in the liver. When the liver is damaged GGT may leak into the bloodstream. High levels of GGT in the blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile in and out of the liver. Bile is a fluid made by the liver. It is important for digestion.A GGT test can't diagnose the specific cause of liver disease. So it is usually done along with or after other liver function tests most often an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test. ALP is another type of liver enzyme. It's often used to help diagnose bone disorders as well as liver disease.,A GGT test is most often used to:,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Gastric Emptying Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/gastric-emptying-tests/,Gastric emptying tests are tests that measure the time it takes for food to empty out of your stomach. After a meal it normally takes 1 1/2 to two hours for food to move out of the stomach and into the small intestine. When your stomach takes longer than normal to empty it's called gastroparesis.If food stays in your stomach for too long it can harden into a solid mass called a bezoar. A bezoar may lead to a dangerous blockage that prevents food from passing into your small intestine.,Gastric emptying tests are most often used to diagnose gastroparesis.,Gastric emptying tests are most often done by a radiologist or radiology technician. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using imaging tests to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. There are different types of tests. You may have one or more of the following tests:barium swallow. During this test:
Glaucoma Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glaucoma-tests/,Glaucoma tests are a group of tests that help diagnose glaucoma a disease of the eye that can cause vision loss and blindness. Glaucoma happens when fluid builds up in the front part of the eye. The extra fluid causes an increase in eye pressure. Increased eye pressure can damage the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries information from the eye to the brain. When the optic nerve is damaged it can lead to serious vision problems. There are several types of glaucoma. The main types are: Open-angle glaucoma also called primary open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type of glaucoma. It happens when the fluid in the eye doesn't drain properly from the eye's drainage canals. The fluid gets backed up in the canals like a clogged sink drain that gets backed up with water. This causes an increase in eye pressure. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over a period of months or years. Most people don't have any symptoms or vision changes at first. Open-angle glaucoma usually affects both eyes at the same time. Closed-angle glaucoma also called angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma. This type of glaucoma isn't common in the United States. It usually affects one eye at a time. In this type of glaucoma drainage canals in the eyes get covered up as if a stopper was put over a drain. Closed-angle glaucoma can be either acute or chronic. Acute closed-angle glaucoma causes a rapid increase in eye pressure. It is a medical emergency. People with acute closed-angle glaucoma can lose vision in a matter of hours if the condition is not treated promptly. Chronic closed-angle glaucoma develops slowly. In many cases there are no symptoms until damage is severe.,Glaucoma tests are used to diagnose glaucoma. If glaucoma is diagnosed early you may be able to take steps to prevent vision loss.,Glaucoma is usually diagnosed with a group of tests commonly known as a comprehensive eye exam. These exams are most often done by an ophthalmologist. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in eye health and in treating and preventing eye disease.
Globulin Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/globulin-test/,Globulins are a group of proteins in your blood. They are made in your liver by your immune system. Globulins play an important role in liver function blood clotting and fighting infection. There are different types of globulins called alpha beta and gamma globulins. Tests to measure globulins include:,Globulin tests can be used to help diagnose a variety of conditions including:,Globulin tests are blood tests. During a blood test a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glomerular-filtration-rate-gfr-test/,A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters help remove waste and excess fluid from the blood. A GFR test estimates how much blood passes through these filters each minute.A GFR can be measured directly but it is a complicated test requiring specialized providers. So GFR is most often estimated using a test called an estimated GFR or eGFR. To get an estimate your provider will use a method known as a GFR calculator. A GFR calculator is a type of mathematical formula that estimates the rate of filtration. It does this by comparing the results of a blood test that measures creatinine a waste product filtered by the kidneys with other information about you. This information includes some or all of the following:,A GFR test is used to help diagnose kidney disease at an early stage when it is most treatable. GFR may also be used to monitor people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other conditions that cause kidney damage. These include diabetes and high blood pressure.,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Glucagon Blood Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glucagon-blood-test/,This test measures the amount of glucagon in the blood. Glucagon is a hormone made by the pancreas. It helps control your body's level of glucose (blood sugar). Glucose is your body's main source of energy. When glucose levels drop the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream. This triggers the production of glucose. As glucose levels rise less glucagon is released. If the pancreas doesn't release the right amount of glucagon it can lead to serious health problems.Other names: glucagon blood test hypoglycemia-glucagon test glucagon-plasma,A glucagon test is most often used to help diagnose the following conditions:,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Glucose in Urine Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glucose-in-urine-test/,A glucose in urine test measures the amount of glucose in your urine (pee). Glucose is a type of sugar. It is the main source of energy for the cells in your body. Your blood carries glucose to your cells.Normally urine contains very little or no glucose. But if you have too much glucose in your blood your kidneys will get rid of some of the extra glucose through your urine. So a high level of urine glucose may mean that your blood glucose is high too and that could be a sign of diabetes. If your urine glucose level is high your health care provider will usually order a blood glucose test to help make a diagnosis.,A glucose in urine test may be part of a urinalysisYour provider may order a urine glucose test if blood glucose testing is difficult for you. A blood test may be difficult if your veins are too small or scarred from repeated punctures or if you have an extreme fear of needles.,"You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe a small container and instructions for how to use the ""clean catch"" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample:home test kit will include a package of strips for testing and instructions on how to do the test. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Talk with your provider about what time of day you should test your urine to get the most accurate results."
Gonorrhea Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/gonorrhea-test/,Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is a bacterial infection spread through vaginal oral or anal sex with an infected person. It can also be spread from a pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth. Gonorrhea can infect both men and women. It is most common in young people aged 15–24. Many people with gonorrhea don't know they have it. So they may spread it to others without knowing it. Men with gonorrhea may have some symptoms. But women often have no symptoms or mistake gonorrhea symptoms for a bladder or vaginal infection. A gonorrhea test looks for the presence of gonorrhea bacteria in your body. The disease can be cured with antibiotics. But if it's not treated gonorrhea can lead to infertility and other serious health problems. In women it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus where a baby can't survive. If not treated promptly ectopic pregnancy can be fatal to the mother.

Kidney stones form when you have high levels of certain minerals or salts in your urine (pee). A kidney stone analysis is a test to find out what a kidney stone is made of. This information helps your health care provider develop a plan to help you reduce your risk of forming more stones in the future. There are four main types of kidney stones: Calcium is the most common type of stone. Uric acid is another common type of stone. Cystine is an uncommon type of stone. It is caused by cystinuria a kidney disease that you inherit from your parents. Struvite is the most uncommon type of stone. It usually forms after a urinary tract infection (UTI). Kidney stones can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pea and sometimes even larger. Very small stones may pass out of your body when you urinate (pee). Larger or odd-shaped stones can get stuck inside your urinary tract and block the flow of urine. This may cause severe pain or bleeding and you may need treatment to get rid of the stones. But with treatment kidney stones usually don't cause permanent damage.,A kidney stone analysis is used to find out what your kidney stone is made of. This helps your provider understand why the stone formed and what will help prevent more stones from forming in the future. This is important because once you've had a stone you're likely to get another one.,To collect a kidney stone you will need a kidney stone strainer to filter your urine and a clean container for your stone. A kidney stone strainer is a device made of fine mesh or gauze. Your provider may give you a strainer or you may get one from a drug store.

Parasites are tiny plants or animals that get nutrients by living off another creature. Parasites that cause malaria are passed to humans through the bite of infected mosquitos. At first, malaria symptoms may be similar to those of the flu. Later on, malaria can lead to life-threatening complications. Malaria is not contagious like a cold or flu, but it can be spread from person to person by mosquitos. If a mosquito bites an infected person, it will spread the parasite to anyone it bites afterward. If you are bitten by an infected mosquito, the parasites will travel into your bloodstream. The parasites will multiply inside your red blood cells and cause illness. Malaria tests look for signs of a malaria infection in the blood. Malaria is common in tropical and subtropical areas. Every year, millions of people are infected with malaria, and hundreds of thousands of people die from the disease. Most people who die from malaria are young children in Africa. While malaria is found in more than 87 countries, most infections and deaths happen in Africa. Malaria is rare in the United States. But U.S. citizens who travel to Africa and other tropical countries are at risk for getting infected.",Malaria tests are used to diagnose malaria. If malaria is diagnosed and treated early it can usually be cured.

Measles and mumps are both very contagious which means that they easily spread from person to person: Measles causes symptoms like a bad cold or the flu. It also causes a flat red rash. The rash usually starts on your face and spreads all over your body. Mumps causes symptoms like the flu with painful swelling of the salivary (spit) glands which makes your cheeks and jaw puffy. In general mumps is a milder disease than measles. Most healthy people with measles or mumps infections will get better in about two weeks or less. But sometimes these infections cause serious complications such as encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Measles may also cause pneumonia and serious problems during pregnancy. In the United States most people have been vaccinated against measles and mumps. As a result measles has become a rare disease in this country. Most cases of measles come from unvaccinated people who have traveled to countries where measles is common and returned home with the disease. Outbreaks of mumps still happen in the U.S. mainly in group living situations such as colleges. Some people who have been vaccinated may still get mumps during an outbreak but they will usually have mild symptoms.,Measles testing and mumps testing can be used to:Rubella also known as German measles is caused by another type of virus.,There are different ways to test for measles and mumps. Antibody tests require a blood sample.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of mono but other viruses can also cause the disease. EBV is a type of herpes virus and is very common. Most Americans have been infected with EBV by the age of 40 but may never get symptoms of mono. Young children infected with EBV usually have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Teens and young adults though are more likely to get mono and experience noticeable symptoms. In fact at least one out of four teens and adults who get EBV will develop mono. Mono can cause symptoms similar to those of the flu. Mono is rarely serious but symptoms can linger for weeks or months. Mono is sometimes called the kissing disease because it is spread through saliva. You can also get mono if you share a drinking glass food or utensils with an a person who has mono.

Many people have staph bacteria living on their skin or in their noses. These bacteria usually don't cause any harm. But when staph enters the body through a cut, scrape, or other open wound, it can cause a skin infection. Most staph skin infections are minor and heal on their own or after treatment with antibiotics. MRSA bacteria are different than other staph bacteria. In a normal staph infection, antibiotics will kill the disease-causing bacteria and prevent them from growing. In a MRSA infection, the antibiotics usually used to treat staph infections don't work. The bacteria are not killed and continue to grow. When common antibiotics don't work on bacterial infections, it's known as antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance makes it very difficult to treat certain bacterial infections. Every year, nearly 3 million people in the United States are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and more than 35,000 people die from the infections. In the past, MRSA infections mostly happened to hospital patients. Now, MRSA is becoming more common in healthy people. The infection can be spread from person to person or through contact with objects that are contaminated with the bacteria. It is not spread through the air like a cold or flu virus. But you can get a MRSA infection if you share personal items such as a towel or a razor. You may also get the infection if you have close, personal contact with someone who has an infected wound. This can happen when large groups of people are close together, such as in a college dorm, locker room, or military barracks. A MRSA test looks for the MRSA bacteria in a sample from a wound, nostril, or other body fluid. MRSA can be treated with special, powerful antibiotics. If left untreated, a MRSA infection can lead to serious illness or death.",This test is most often used to find out if you have a MRSA infection.

Normally only small levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are found in the bloodstream. High levels can mean your heart isn't pumping as much blood as your body needs. When this happens it's known as heart failure sometimes called congestive heart failure.Natriuretic peptide tests measure the levels of BNP or NT-proBNP in your blood. Your health care provider may order a BNP test or an NT-proBNP test but not both. They are both useful in diagnosing heart failure but rely on different types of measurements. The choice will depend on the equipment available in your provider's recommended laboratory.,A BNP test or an NT-proBNP test is most often used to diagnose or rule out heart failure. If you've already been diagnosed with heart failure the test may be used to:,For a BNP test or an NT-proBNP test a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Neurological Exam,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/neurological-exam/,A neurological exam checks for disorders of the central nervous system. The central nervous system is made of your brain spinal cord and nerves from these areas. It controls and coordinates everything you do including muscle movement organ function and even complex thinking and planning.There are more than 600 types of central nervous system disorders. The most common disorders include:,A neurological exam is used to help find out if you have a disorder of the nervous system. Early diagnosis can help you get the right treatment and may decrease long-term complications.,A neurological exam is usually performed by a neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain and spinal cord. During the exam your neurologist will test different functions of the nervous system. The types of tests will depend on your symptoms but most neurological exams include tests of some or all of the following:
Nitrites in Urine,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/nitrites-in-urine/,A test called a urinalysis checks a sample of your urine (pee) to see if it has nitrites. Nitrites in urine may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI).UTIs are caused by different types of bacteria. Many of these types of bacteria change a normal chemical in your urine called nitrates into another chemical called nitrites. So if you have nitrites in your urine it usually means that you have a urinary tract infection (UTI).,A urinalysis which includes a test for nitrites in urine is used to check your general health including the health of your urinary tract and kidneys. It may also be used to check for a UTI.,"You will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe a small container and instructions for how to use the ""clean catch"" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample:"
Nonstress Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/nonstress-test/,A nonstress test is a safe noninvasive test for pregnant women. Noninvasive means it doesn't cut into the skin or enter any part of the body. The test measures the heart rate of an unborn baby as the baby moves in the uterus. In most healthy babies the heart rate also known as the fetal heart rate increases during movement. If your nonstress test results showed that the heart rate was not normal it may mean that your baby is not getting enough oxygen. If this happens you may need more testing or treatment or in some cases delivery may be induced. Inducing labor is when a provider gives you medicine or uses other methods to start labor before it begins naturally.Other names: fetal nonstress test NST,A nonstress test is used to check a baby's heart rate before birth. The test is usually done in the third trimester of pregnancy most often between weeks 38 and 42.,The test may be done in your provider's office or in a special prenatal area of a hospital. It generally includes the following steps:
Obesity Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/obesity-screening/,Obesity is the condition of having too much body fat. It's not just a matter of appearance. Obesity can put you at risk for a variety of chronic and serious health problems. These include: Heart disease Type 2 diabetes High blood pressure Arthritis Certain types of cancer .Experts say obesity is major problem in the U.S. Today more than 30 percent of U.S. adults and 20 percent of U.S. children have obesity. Children with obesity are at risk for many of the same health problems as adults with obesity. An obesity screening may use a measurement called a BMI (body mass index) and other tests to find out if you or your child is overweight or has obesity. Being overweight means you have excess body weight. While not as severe as obesity it may also lead to serious health problems.,A BMI (body mass index) is a calculation based on your weight and height. While it's hard to directly measure fat on the body a BMI can provide a good estimate.online BMI calculatorThe results will be in the form of a percentile. A percentile is a type of comparison between an individual and a group. For example if your child has a BMI in the 50th percentile it means 50 percent of children of the same age and sex have a lower BMI and 50 percent will have a higher BMI. Your child's BMI will show one of the following results:,An obesity screening is used to find out if you or your child is at an unhealthy weight. If the screening shows that you or your child is overweight or has obesity your provider will check to see if there is medical issue causing the excess weight. Your provider will also teach you about what you can do to reduce your weight and improve your health.

It causes repeated unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions). To get rid of obsessions people with OCD may perform certain actions over and over again (compulsions). Most people with OCD know that their compulsions don't make sense but still can't stop doing them. Sometimes they feel these behaviors are the only way to prevent something bad from happening. Compulsions may temporarily relieve anxiety.OCD is different than regular habits and routines. It's not unusual to brush your teeth at the same time every morning or sit in the same chair for dinner every night. With OCD compulsive behaviors can take up several hours a day. They can get in the way of normal daily life. OCD usually starts in childhood adolescence or early adulthood. Researchers don't know what causes OCD. But many believe genetics and/or a problem with chemicals in the brain may play a role. It often runs in families. An OCD test can help diagnose the disorder so you can get treated. Treatment can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.,This test is used to find out if certain symptoms are being caused by OCD.,Your primary care provider may give you a physical exam and order blood tests to find out if your symptoms are being caused by certain medicines another mental illnessIf you are being tested by a mental health provider he or she may ask you detailed questions about your thoughts and behaviors.
Opioid Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/opioid-testing/,"Opioid testing looks for the presence of opioids in urine blood or saliva. Opioids are powerful drugs that are used to relieve pain. They are often prescribed to help treat serious injuries or illnesses. In addition to reducing pain opioids can also increase feelings of pleasure and well-being. Once an opioid dose wears off it's natural to want those feelings to return. So even using opioids as prescribed by a doctor can lead to dependence and addiction.The terms ""opioids"" and ""opiates"" are often used in the same way. An opiate is a type of opioid that comes naturally from the opium poppy plant. Opiates include the medicines codeine and morphine as well as the illegal drug heroin. Other opioids are synthetic (man-made) or part synthetic (part natural and part man-made). Both types are designed to produce effects similar to a naturally occurring opiate. These types of opioids include:",Opioid testing is often used to monitor people who are taking prescription opioids. The test helps ensure you are taking the right amount of medicine.drug screeningOpioid testing may also be included as part of an overall marijuana. These screenings test for a variety of drugs such as cocaine as well as opioids. Drug screenings may be used for:,"Most opioid tests require that you give a urine sample. You will be given instructions to provide a ""clean catch"" sample."
Osmolality Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/osmolality-tests/,Osmolality tests measure the amount of certain substances in blood urine or stool. These include glucose (sugar) urea (a waste product made in the liver) and several electrolytes such as sodium potassium and chloride. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals. They help control the amount of fluids in your body. The test can show whether you have an unhealthy balance of fluids in your body. An unhealthy fluid balance can be caused by many different conditions. These include excess salt intake kidney disease heart disease and some types of poisoning.Other names: serum osmolality plasma osmolality urine osmolality stool osmolality osmotic gap,Osmolality tests may be used for a variety of reasons. diarrhea also known as a serum osmolality test is most often used to:bacterialSometimes blood plasma is also tested for osmolality. Serum and plasma are both parts of the blood. Plasma contains substances including blood cells and certain proteins. Serum is a clear fluid that does not contain these substances.parasitic infection.,(serum osmolality or plasma osmolality):
Ova and Parasite Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ova-and-parasite-test/,An ova and parasite test looks for parasites and their eggs (ova) in a sample of your stool. A parasite is a tiny plant or animal that gets nutrients by living off another creature. Parasites can live in your digestive system and cause illness. These are known as intestinal parasites. Intestinal parasites affect tens of millions of people around the world. They are more common in countries where sanitation is poor but millions of people in the United States get infected every year.The most common types of parasites in the U.S. include giardia and cryptosporidium often referred to as crypto. These parasites are commonly found in:,An ova and parasite test is used to find out if parasites are infecting your digestive system. If you've already been diagnosed with a parasite infection the test may be used to see if your treatment is working.,You will need to provide a sample of your stool. Your provider or your child's provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following:
Panic Disorder Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/panic-disorder-test/,Panic disorder is a condition in which you have frequent panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear and anxiety. In addition to emotional distress a panic attack can cause physical symptoms. These include chest pain rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath. During a panic attack some people think they are having a heart attack. A panic attack can last anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour. Some panic attacks happen in response to a stressful or scary situation such as a car accident. Other attacks happen without a clear reason. Panic attacks are common affecting at least 11% of adults each year. Many people have one or two attacks in their lifetime and recover without treatment. But if you have repeated unexpected panic attacks and are in constant fear of getting a panic attack you may have panic disorder. Panic disorder is rare. It only affects 2 to 3 percent of adults each year. It's twice as common in women than in men. While panic disorder is not life-threatening it can be upsetting and affect your quality of life. If left untreated it can lead to other serious problems including depression and substance use. A panic disorder test can help diagnose the condition so you can get the right treatment.,A panic disorder test is used to find out if certain symptoms are caused by panic disorder or a physical condition such as a heart attack.,Your primary care provider may give you a physical exam and ask you about your feelings mood behavior patterns and other symptoms. Your provider may also order blood tests and/or tests on your heart to rule out a heart attack or other physical conditions.
Pap Smear,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/pap-smear/,A Pap smear is a test to help prevent cervical cancer or find it early. The cervix is the lower narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina. During a Pap smear a health care provider collects cells from the cervix and sends them to a lab.At the lab the cells are checked under a microscope for cancer or for signs that they may become cancer. Cells that may become cancer are called precancers. Finding and treating precancers can help prevent cervical cancer. The Pap smear is also a reliable way to find cancer early when it's easier to treat.,A Pap smear looks for abnormal changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Sometimes the cells collected during a Pap smear are also checked for HPV a virus that can cause cell changes that may lead to cancer.HPV testsPap smears and cervical cancer screening tests that look for cancer before you have any symptoms. Research shows that cervical cancer screening can greatly reduce the number of new cervical cancer cases and deaths from the disease. Ask your provider which test is right for you or if you should have both a Pap smear and an HPV test.,During a Pap smear you will lie on an exam table. Your provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to widen the vagina so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a small soft brush or swab to collect cells from the cervix. The cell sample is sent to a lab for testing.pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam your provider examines your uterus ovaries and genital area. But a pelvic exam doesn't always include a Pap smear. So when you have a pelvic exam ask your provider whether you'll have a Pap smear too.

These illnesses can affect your nose throat lungs and bronchial tubes (the airways that carry air to your lungs). Parainfluenza tests check whether a parainfluenza virus is causing an illness. The tests usually use a sample of fluid from your nose or mucus from your lungs.Parainfluenza viruses are also called human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs). They aren't the same as flu (influenza) viruses. The flu is more common in winter. In the U.S. parainfluenza viruses are more common in the spring summer and fall.,Most healthy people who have symptoms of a respiratory illness do not need parainfluenza testing. That's because they usually get better on their own. But you may need this test if you have a high risk of getting seriously ill from a parainfluenza infection because you:viralFor these people treatment decisions depend on knowing whether they have a bacterial infection or respiratory pathogens panel. So parainfluenza testing may be done as part of a antibiotics.,Tests to diagnose parainfluenza viruses are usually done on a sample of fluid from your nose or chest.
Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/parathyroid-hormone-pth-test/,This test measures the level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood. PTH also known as parathormone is made by your parathyroid glands. These are four pea-sized glands in your neck. PTH controls the level of calcium in the blood. Calcium is a mineral that keeps your bones and teeth healthy and strong. It's also essential for the proper functioning of your nerves muscles and heart.If calcium blood levels are too low your parathyroid glands will release PTH into the blood. This causes calcium levels to rise. If calcium blood levels are too high these glands will stop making PTH.,A PTH test is most often used along with calcium testing to:,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/partial-thromboplastin-time-ptt-test/,A partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test uses a blood sample to measure how long it takes for your blood to make a clot. Normally when you get a cut or injury that causes bleeding many different types of proteins in your blood work together to make a clot to stop the bleeding. These proteins are called coagulation factors or clotting factors.If any of your clotting factors are missing at a low level or not working properly your blood may:,A PTT test is used to check for problems with a specific group of blood clotting factors. The test is done to:,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle.

Another type of PCR known as quantitative PCR (qPCR) measures the amount of pathogens in the sample. qPCR can be done at the same time as PCR or rtPCR.
PDL1 (Immunotherapy) Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/pdl1-immunotherapy-tests/,"A PD-L1 test uses a sample of cancerous tumor tissue to measure how much of a protein called PD-L1 is found on the cancer cells. If you have certain types of cancer PD-L1 testing can check whether you may benefit from a type of cancer treatment called immunotherapy. Immunotherapy helps your own immune system fight cancer.Normally PD-L1 is found on certain healthy cells. It acts as a kind of ""brake"" to stop cells in your immune system called T cells from attacking healthy cells in your body. If cancer cells have high amounts of PD-L1 they can turn your T cells off so they can't attack the cancer cells.",PD-L1 testing is used to look for the PD-L1 protein on cancer cells in a sample of tumor tissue. The test also measures the amount of PD-L1 in the tissue. This information helps find out if immunotherapy medicines could help control your cancer.,PD-L1 tests are done on a tissue sample from a tumor. If you're having surgery to remove a tumor a sample will be taken for testing.biopsyThere are many ways to do a biopsy. The type of biopsy you have depends on the type of cancer you have and where the tumor is located. In general a biopsy may be done using:
PET Scan,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/pet-scan/,A PET (positron emission tomography) scan is an imaging test that looks at how well your tissues and organs are working. It also checks for signs of cancer. The scan uses a small amount of a radioactive substance called a tracer.The tracer settles in areas of your body that have high levels of chemical activity. This activity can be a sign of cancer or other diseases. The tracer can also help measure blood flow oxygen use and changes in the metabolism of a particular tissue or organ. Metabolism is a chemical process that your body uses to change food into energy.,A PET scan is most often used to:CT scanA PET scan is often done along with a x-ray that takes a series of pictures as it rotates around you.,Before the scan you will change into a hospital gown. You may be asked to empty your bladder. During the scan:

Genes may also be the reason some people have bad side effects to a medicine while others have none.,Pharmacogenetic testing may be used to:,Testing is usually done on blood or saliva.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/phenylketonuria-pku-screening/,A PKU screening test is a blood test given to newborns one to three days after birth. PKU stands for phenylketonuria. It is a rare disorder that prevents the body from breaking down part of a protein called phenylalanine (Phe). Phe is in all foods that contain protein such as milk meats and nuts. It's also in an artificial sweetener called aspartame.If you have PKU and eat foods with Phe the Phe will build up in your blood. If the level gets too high it can permanently damage your nervous system and brain. The damage can cause many types of health problems including seizures psychiatric problems and learning and developmental disabilities. A PKU screening test diagnoses PKU by measuring the amount of Phe in a blood sample.,A PKU test is used to see if a newborn has high blood levels of Phe in their blood. This may mean the baby has PKU. More tests may be needed to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.,A health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol.

Procalcitonin Test,https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/procalcitonin-test/,A procalcitonin test measures the level of procalcitonin in your blood. Normally you have very low levels of procalcitonin in your blood. But if you have a serious bacterial infection the cells in many parts of your body will release procalcitonin into your bloodstream. A high level of procalcitonin in your blood may be a sign of a serious infection or sepsis.Sepsis (also called septicemia) is your immune system's extreme response to an infection usually from bacteria. Sepsis happens when an infection you already have spreads into your bloodstream and triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. It causes inflammation and blood clots. Without quick treatment sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage organ failure or even death.,A procalcitonin test is mostly used if you are seriously ill and your provider thinks you may have a systemic infection (an infection that affects your entire body). The test helps find out whether bacteria or a virus is causing your infection. For example a procalcitonin test can help tell the difference between bacterial and viral pneumonia. This matters because antibioticsThis test is usually used in the hospital for very sick people who are in the emergency room or have already been admitted to the hospital.,A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle.
